Create a stabilized rocket

Current Hardware:
* Arduino MKRZERO
* MPU-6050
* CP2102 (for debugging on the MKRZERO)
* 8 GB SD Card (for telemetry)

This little science experiment is an attempt to create an Estes-like
rocket that can stabilize itself in flight and maybe do more
sophisticated things in the future.
